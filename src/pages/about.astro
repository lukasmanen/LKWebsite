      <h2>Lukas Kelloniemi</h2>
      <p>
        My fascination with code started early in school with game programming. That interest eventually shifted toward Python, where I built my first face recognition algorithm using the OpenCV library. It was a deep dive into computer vision that opened my eyes to what was possible with code. From there, I experimented with building cloud-integrated login applications for fun, creating systems where users could save images directly to the cloud.

        I spent two years working toward a path in computer science, but I eventually decided to give it up and put my focus into other interests. On March 7, 2024, I picked up Blender because I wanted to understand more about computer graphics. At that time, I wasn't thinking much about coding I just wanted to explore the 3D world. This led me to the VFX for Games and Film program at Visual Magic, where I received my education in 3D and Compositing.

        It was at Visual Magic that I first learned what compositing actually was. Seeing how all the different elements come together in the final script sparked a massive interest in the craft. That journey brought me to where I am today. While I am now back to using Python and BlinkScript to push Nuke’s engine, my main priority is mastering the art of the shot. I’ve realized that my technical past gives me a unique way to look at an image, but I am currently dedicated to developing the creative eye needed to make those images feel real. When I'm not in the node graph, I'm either chilling or trying out some new Ideas!
